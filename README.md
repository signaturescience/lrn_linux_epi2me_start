# Instructions
This repository contains the startup bash script necessary to run/start the custom EPI2MELabs server and notebooks designed for CDC-LRN labs to perform analysis of sequencing data generated by target agnostic sequencing of potential RNA viruses.

To successfully setup/run this tool you will need:
1) directory containing hosts/ and SeqScreen database
2) directory containing 1 or more MinION sequencing runs

edit the included file to update the DB_DIR and DATA_DIR to point to the correct locations (#1 and #2 respectively)
execute the script:
` bash dockerCmd.sh`
